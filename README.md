# ImageTool
Grab Bitmaps, Sprites, Bobs, edit the palette, and export all!

WARNING
The code in this project is not at all a good example of good practices.
It was started a long time ago, and made for Demomaking, which allows lots
of things you would not do in a professional project. It's a bit like not
making your bed when you sleep at the hotel: It's a shortcut you're happy to
take, but you would not do that at home (or would you?).
